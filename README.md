# Imgblock

Imgblock can be described as Flashblock but for images.  Basically it stops
images from loading until you click on them once, at which point it loads them.
If the image is a link to somewhere, clicking on it will load it, afterwards
clicking on it will use the link.

I made this because I have been getting into reducing my bandwidth usage but I
couldn't find one definitive solution to this problem, so I made it.  It's been
a great exercise.

This is still an alpha/beta, and it may never leave that state so use it at your
own risk, but from what I can tell it shouldn't break any websites
significantly. ;)
